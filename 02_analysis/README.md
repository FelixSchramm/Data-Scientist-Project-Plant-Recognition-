- 6. Validate Observations with Statistical Tests




## 1. 

# For plant type detection 
# For pitures with plants only 
# Multiclass Classification: Which plant is it
# Multiclass classification involves predicting a target variable that can take three or more classes.

# For plant detection 
# For picutre with plants and other things
# Binary Classification: Is it a plant 
# Binary classification is a type of classification problem where the goal is to predict a target variable that can only take two possible values, often labeled as positive class (1) and negative class (0).
