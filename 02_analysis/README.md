# Plan of Analyis 

## Step 1/ Data mining + DataViz’: Deadline June 19th
1. Define Project Context and Scope
2. Dataset Exploration
3. Highlight Dataset Structure and Biases
4. Generate Graphical Representations
5. Provide Commentary and Business Insights
6. Validate Observations with Statistical Tests




## 1. Define Project Context and Scope
For plant type detection 
For pitures with plants only 
Multiclass Classification: Which plant is it
Multiclass classification involves predicting a target variable that can take three or more classes.

For plant detection 
For picutre with plants and other things
Binary Classification: Is it a plant 
Binary classification is a type of classification problem where the goal is to predict a target variable that can only take two possible values, often labeled as positive class (1) and negative class (0).





## 2. Dataset Exploration
