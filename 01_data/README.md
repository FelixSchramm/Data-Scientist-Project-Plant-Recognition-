# The data & how to access it

## Plant Data Sources for Species Identification & Disease Detection

## 1. Plant Species Identification Datasets  
*(For training a model to classify plant species from images)*  

### 1.1 High-Quality Labeled Datasets  

#### 1.1.1 V2 Plant Seedlings Dataset  
- **Source**: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/vbookshelf/v2-plant-seedlings-dataset)  
- **Content**: Images of seedlings (crop plants and weeds) with species labels.  
- **Use Case**: Train a classifier to distinguish plant species.  
- **Pros**: Clean, well-labeled, focused on young plants.  
- **Cons**: Limited to seedlings, not mature plants.  

#### 1.1.2 Open Images Dataset  
- **Source**: [Google Open Images](https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/download.html)  
- **Content**: General-purpose images (includes plants but not exclusively).  
- **Use Case**: Supplemental data for broader plant variety.  
- **Pros**: Large-scale, diverse.  
- **Cons**: Requires filtering for plant-specific images.  

#### 1.1.3 COCO (Common Objects in Context)  
- **Source**: [COCO Dataset](https://cocodataset.org/#home)  
- **Content**: Broad object detection dataset (includes some plant categories).  
- **Use Case**: Contextual detection (e.g., plants among other objects).  
- **Pros**: Well-annotated, large.  
- **Cons**: Not specialized for plants.

## 2. Plant Disease Detection Datasets  
*(For identifying diseases in classified plant species)*  

### 2.1 Dedicated Disease Datasets  

#### 2.1.1 New Plant Diseases Dataset  
- **Source**: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset)  
- **Content**: 38 classes of healthy/diseased plant leaves.  
- **Use Case**: Disease classifier for common crops (e.g., tomato, potato).  
- **Pros**: Large, well-organized, high-quality images.  
- **Cons**: Limited to specific crops.  

#### 2.1.2 PlantVillage Dataset  
- **Source**: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/abdallahalidev/plantvillage-dataset)  
- **Content**: 54,000+ images of healthy/diseased plants (multiple species).  
- **Use Case**: Best dataset for disease classification.  
- **Pros**: Huge, research-standard, balanced classes.  
- **Cons**: Lab conditions (white background), not field images.  

#### 2.1.3 Plant Disease Dataset (Saroz014)  
- **Source**: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/saroz014/plant-disease)  
- **Content**: Smaller dataset with disease-labeled plant images.  
- **Use Case**: Supplemental data.  
- **Pros**: Simple, easy to use.  
- **Cons**: Smaller than PlantVillage.

## 3. Recommended Workflow  
1. **Species Classification**:  
   - Primary: **V2 Plant Seedlings Dataset** (for seedlings).  
   - Secondary: **Open Images/COCO** (for mature plants).  
2. **Disease Detection**:  
   - Primary: **PlantVillage Dataset**.  
   - Secondary: **New Plant Diseases Dataset**.

## 4. Additional Suggestions  
- **Field Data**: For real-world images, explore [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/) or [PlantCLEF](https://www.imageclef.org/PlantCLEF).  
- **Data Augmentation**: Use synthetic data if field variability is limited.
